Userscript/Style to bring back the old top bar to google.

# New Version
A new version of this script is in the works, for updates, join [this discord server](https://discord.gg/NcX3rRFHs6)

# Information
![How it looks](https://github.com/CallyHam/Google-Top-Bar/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)
The topbar itself works perfectly fine, the style itself just needs some fixing to make it fit in with google, i won't be working on this anymore so feel free to fork this and add whatever fixes/stuff you like.

# NOTE: I would not recommend using this as it is quite poorly made and could use a re-write, though if you do decide to use it expect issues.
